# XYFlow & LitFlow Test Bench

A unified Vite-powered environment to compare React (XYFlow) and Lit (LitFlow) renderings of the same Graphviz source logic.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npx vite
   ```

## Local Development & HMR

If you are contributing to the [LitFlow project](https://github.com/ghchinoy/litflow) and want to see your changes reflected here instantly via Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

1. Clone `litflow` into a sibling directory of this project.
2. Open `main.tsx` in this directory.
3. Switch the imports:
   - Comment out: `import '@ghchinoy/litflow';`
   - Uncomment: `import '../../../litflow/src/lit-flow';`
4. Update `vite.config.ts` to allow access to the sibling directory:
   ```ts
   server: {
     fs: {
       allow: ['..', '../../../litflow']
     }
   }
   ```

This configuration bridges the gap between different frameworks using the standardized JSON schema generated by `dot-to-xyflow`.
